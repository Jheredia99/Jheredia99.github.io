# Welcome to my page :)

This storyboard was a result of my hard work this entire semester. 

It was certaintly a journey it... it all started from the learning how to use Github and then Twine. As well has getting familiar with all the different thing you can do. For example, adding text, passages, multimedia, conditionals, variables, and changing and styling the twine story. This was all completed in the varierty the mini assignments in the repository. 

#What is the story about?

You will get to learn a little of the most famous tudor king, Henry VII. Starting from getting to know his unique character, facts, succession as king, important events in this reign, his realtion with the church, and finally you get to play a game after all the learning.
Henry VII ruled England for 38 years, from 1509 until 1547 and was well known for his six wives. He started his reign with firm foundations that later lead to Act of Appeals, Act of Supremacy, English Reformation, Holy League, Oath of Succession, Pilgrimage of Grace, Poor Law, Six Articles, Solway Moss, Supplication against the Ordinaries, and Ten Articles.
